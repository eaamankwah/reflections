When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Answer: when sharing or collaborating with others on my work. 
It is also important to create a backup on a GitHub repository apart from the local copy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer: Pulling changes manually gives full control so that unexpected changes on code or new features would not occur.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Answer:Forks, clones, and branches are all different ways one can add new changes without loosing the original version.  Branching adds new changes in the same repository.  Forking and cloning are copy mechanisms of an entire repository to a new location.  Forking only happens on GitHub where repository is copied from an original GitHub to a new GitHub. Cloning copies any Git repository to a GitHub, local repository and wherever there is access.

Branching helps when working on a new feature that will add changes to a repository and at the same time keeping reference to the old or origin version. It is also great for collaborating on a project. Cloning helps to work and make changes on a repository locally instead of using GitHub environment. Forking helps when making changes to repositories without having permission to modify the original work.
