When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Answer: when sharing or collaborating with others on my work. 
It is also important to create a backup on a gitbub repository apart from the local copy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer: Pulling changes manually gives full controll so that unexpected changes on code or new features would not occur.
